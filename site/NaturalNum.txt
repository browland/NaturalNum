NaturalNum
==========

A python module for easy conversion of numeric values to natural language with 
full internationalization.  E.g. "2100" can be mapped to 
"two thousand one hundred", "deux mille cent", "2.wav,1000.wav,1.wav,100.wav", 
or any other representation, according to rules-based configuration.

Quick Start
-----------

The script example.py provides an example usage of the library, allowing 
command line evaluation of natural language.  E.g.:

$ python example.py
Usage: example.py <integer to translate> <locale code>
$ python example.py 123456 fr_FR
['cent', 'vingt', 'trois', 'mille', 'quatre', 'cent', 'cinquante', 'six']
$ python example.py 123456 en_GB
['one', 'hundred', 'and', 'twenty', 'three', 'thousand', 'four', 'hundred', 
'and', 'fifty', 'six']

- The locale code must match a file in the config directory.
- example.py can be used as a starting point to use the library any way you 
  want.
- If new language rules are required (or amendments are required for existing 
  ones), browse the language config files, and read about how rules are set up 
  below.

Motivation
----------

Generation of natural language - even just for numbers - can be complex.  
Generally, in natural languages a number is represented as a series of words 
drawn from a relatively small vocabulary (e.g. 'one', 'two', ...), together 
with some multipliers (e.g. 'hundred', 'thousand') and linking words 
(e.g. 'and').  For example, when learning how to count, you perhaps might 
start learning how to say one to ten.  Then it is relatively easy to get as 
far as one hundred, by learning the words for twenty, thirty, etc., and 
combining them with what you already know.  Then it is even easier to go into 
the hundreds and thousands once you know how to group numbers by place-value 
and combine them with their multiplier.

Based on this understanding, a first attempt in converting numeric values to 
natural language would be to create a lookup table for each word in the 
vocabulary, then write an algorithm to stitch the words together based on some 
logic.  At first this seems a perfectly adequate approach.  In fact it probably 
would be the best choice for a single language, but as soon as 
internationalization is attempted the complexity would increase drastically.  
This is due to differences in not just the vocabulary across different 
languages, but also the rules for grouping, multipliers and other tricky 
corner-cases.

For example, in English the number 100 is spoken as "one hundred".  But in 
French the same number is rendered "cent".  So not only is the vocabulary 
different, but so is the syntax (there is no need to specify the multiplier 
of hundreds if it is 1, in French).  Additionally, the number 101 is said 
"one hundred and one" in English, but is simply "cent un" in French, missing 
the linking word.  Another interesting example is to compare how tens and 
units are combined by English and German.  In English, 21 is "twenty one".  
But in German it is "einundzwanzig" ("one and twenty").  Furthermore, the 
German rendering is a single word, whereas the English is two separate words.  
Further complexities can be found in all languages.

Features
--------

NaturalNum offers the following:

- Arbitrary mapping of numeric values to lists of string tokens, allowing a 
  rich set of natural language representations
- Rules-based approach, expressing knowledge of natural languages 
  declaratively.  This strategy scales horizontally - the rules for different 
  languages are separately maintained, rather than nested among each other in a
  single algorithm.
- Rules are triggered by pattern-matching.  This is a natural choice 
  considering how equivalence classes often depend on the 'place value' of 
  digits.
- Wildcarding and variable-binding is possible ('digivars').  This allows 
  generic rules to be created for cases where the natural language 
  representation is based on digits within the input value, e.g. when mapping 
  to resource tokens such as audio filenames.
- Rules can resolve a subset of the input number recursively, to allow reuse.  
  This means the size of the rule-set scales very well with an increasing 
  domain of input numbers.

Configuration
-------------

*** BASICS

Each supported natural language must be configured with rules; sample languages 
are provided in config/.  

For a given input numeric value, the rules config for the current language is 
searched from top-to-bottom.  A rule is triggered as soon as the input numeric 
value matches the pattern on the left-hand-side of each rule.  The 
pattern-matching is based first on the number of digits, and then on the values 
of the digits themselves.  As soon as a match is found no further matching will 
be attempted.  This means rules should be specified from the most specific to 
the most general.

The right-hand-side of each rule is always resolved to a list of tokens 
representing the natural language representation for the matched numeric input.

The left-hand and right-hand sides of each rule are separated by '='.

A very simple example rule for English follows (note that '#' indicates the 
beginning of a comment, which is ignored by the reader):

21=twenty,one     ## rule for 21

The list of tokens on the right-hand-side can be anything, so they could be 
used to identify resources, e.g. audio files containing spoken utterences for 
playback.  A very simple example mapping the digits 0-9 to a corresponding 
audio filename is given below:

0=0.wav           ## an input of "0" is matched, and mapped to the output 
                  ## string "0.wav"
1=1.wav           ## "1" -> "1.wav"
                  ## (...)
9=9.wav           ## "9" -> "9.wav"

So far this does not seem too interesting; it is just a simple lookup table 
mapping literal numeric values to literal strings.  It would not scale, and 
there would be a lot of repetition.  

However, there is a way to make these rules more compact.

*** DIGIVARS

A digivar is a wildcard character which, when appearing on the left-hand side 
of a rule will match any single digit in the same position.  What makes 
digivars especially useful is that they act as a variable which is bound to 
the matched digit, and when referenced on the right-hand-side (preceded by $) 
the digivar will be replaced with its bound value.  Digivars can be mixed 
freely with literal values on the right-hand side of a rule.

For example, we can simplify the rules previously given for 0-9, as a single 
rule:

u=$u.wav

Any single digit value (0-9) will match this rule.  The single digit in the 
matched numeric value will be bound to the digivar 'u' (any alphabetic 
character could have been chosen, but 'u' seems a natural choice for 'units').
When $u is encountered on the right-hand-side, this will be replaced with the 
digit matched to digivar 'u', followed by '.wav'.  So '1' would resolve to 
'1.wav' and so on, up to '9.wav'.

There are a few restrictions to the use of digivars:  

- A digivar can only be a single alphabetic character (this makes the 
left-hand-side value easier to read from a pattern-matching perspective).  If 
several alphabetic characters appear on the left-hand side in sequence, it will 
be assumed they are seperate single-character digivars.
- Digivars must be alphabetic characters (case-sensitive), to distinguish from 
literal digits.  
- The same digivar cannot be used more than once on the left-hand-side (you 
cannot bind the same digivar to more than one digit).

It is perhaps intuitive that digivars are scoped only to the single rule they 
are defined in.  So if the same digivar 'u' appears in a number of rules, it is 
bound in each case to the digit matched in that rule only.

Note that it is not mandatory for a digivar to appear on the right-hand-side.  
So digivars can be used as straightforward wildcards, although there is no 
obvious use-case for this.

Care must be taken in defining rules in the correct order (most specific to 
least specific) to get the correct result.  The following is a more advanced 
example of how we might continue the previous examples as far as 0-999 using 
digivars.  Note that for the remainder of this example, we will define a 
minimal vocabulary of audio filenames to be the following:

- 0.wav, 1.wav, ..., 19.wav
- 20.wav, 30.wav, up to 90.wav
- 100.wav (represents "hundred", not "one hundred")
- and.wav (linking word)

The limited vocabularly means we will have to compose tokens together in 
sequence on the right-hand side, where necessary.  For clarity, we will not 
specify the file extension (.wav) on the right-hand side of each rule (in 
practice it would be straightforward for a calling application to append the 
extension to each of the generated tokens)

## Single Digits (units)
u=$u                               ## Units (e.g. 7 = 7.wav)

## Double Digits (tens and units)
t0=$t0                             ## Exact tens (e.g. 30 = 30.wav)
1u=1$u                             ## 11-19 (e.g. 19 = 19.wav)
tu=$t0,$u                          ## Remaining 'tens and units' 
                                   ## (e.g 56 = 50.wav, 6.wav)

## Three Digits (hundreds, tens and units)
h00=$h,100                         ## Exact hundreds 
                                   ## (e.g. 300.wav = 3.wav, 100.wav)
h0u=$h,100,and,$u                  ## Hundreds and unit with no tens 
                                   ## (e.g. 709 = 7.wav, 100.wav, and.wav, 
                                   ## 9.wav)
ht0=$h,100,and,$t0                 ## Hundreds and exact tens 
                                   ## (e.g. 850 = 8.wav, 100.wav, and.wav, 
                                   ## 50.wav)
h1u=$h,100,and,1$u                 ## Hundreds and 11-19 
                                   ## (e.g. 218 = 2.wav, 100.wav, and.wav, 
                                   ## 18.wav)
htu=$h,100,and,$t0,$u              ## Hundreds and remaining tens and units 
                                   ## (e.g. 546 = 5.wav, 100.wav, and.wav, 
                                   ## 50.wav, 6.wav)

This is some good progress; we have specified the natural language rules for 
all numbers 0-999 in 9 rules.  However this is not perfect, as there is some 
repetition.  The rules for the single and double digits are duplicated further 
down in the rules for 3 digits.  Without any further tricks, this redundancy 
would fan out as patterns for more digits are provided.

This is where recursive rules come into the picture.

*** RECURSIVE RULES

It would be useful if a rule could defer part of its evaluation to another
rule.  For example, a number of languages have the same rules for hundreds, 
tens and units, regardless of where they appear in the value.  More 
specifically, in English, we should not have to repeat ourselves when we define 
how the value "34" is represented when evaluating "34,000", "134", or 
"34,034,034".  The latter case could be decomposed into steps in an informal 
'rule' as follows:

34,034,034:
+- (34) million
+- (34) thousand
+- and
+- (34)

In all but one of the steps, the value 34 is placed in brackets to show it is 
delegated to a separate rule which is already defined for 'tens and units'.

This is very similar to how recursive rules work in NaturalNum.  In the example 
above, the rules for single and double digits were repeated within the rules 
for hundreds, tens and units.  This would fan out into increasing redundancy as
values of increasing length are supported.

However, we could change the way three digits are resolved, as follows:

## Single Digits (units)
u=$u                               ## Units (e.g. 7 = 7.wav)

## Double Digits (tens and units)
t0=$t0                             ## Exact tens (e.g. 30 = 30.wav)
1u=1$u                             ## 11-19 (e.g. 19 = 19.wav)
tu=$t0,$u                          ## Remaining 'tens and units' 
                                   ## (e.g 56 = 50.wav, 6.wav)

## Three Digits (hundreds, tens and units)
h00=$h,100                         ## Exact hundreds 
                                   ## (e.g. 300.wav = 3.wav, 100.wav)
h0u=$h,100,and,$u                  ## Hundreds and unit with no tens 
                                   ## (e.g. 709 = 7.wav, 100.wav, and.wav, 
                                   ## 9.wav)
htu=$h,100,and,($t$u)              ## Hundreds and tens and units - tens
                                   ## and units are deferred to a matching
                                   ## rule
                                   ## e.g. 546 = 5.wav, 
                                   ##            100.wav, 
                                   ##            and.wav, 
                                   ##            (56)
                                   ##              = 50.wav, 6.wav
								   
The single and double digits are specified as in the previous example.  But 
there are now only three rules for three digits, instead of five.  This doesn't 
sound like a huge improvement, but as more digits are added the benefits are 
compounded (especially when the rules for three digits are re-used in 4+ 
digits).

The logic here is as follows.  When "546" is resolved, the first rule matched 
is the final one (matching the pattern "htu").  This resolves to ("5", "100", 
"and"), but the tens and units are parenthesised, so are resolved recursively.  
This means that the digits matching "$t$u" ("56") are fed back through the 
rules, matching the rule with pattern "tu".  This rule would then give the 
remainder of the result, which is "50", "6".

Conclusion
----------
NaturalNum goes a long way towards solving the problem of natural language 
representation of integer values.  It is not perfect however, as shown by the 
following issues:

- It is still hard to write new rules.  Defining rules for a new language 
  requires some study, particularly finding the edge cases and identifying 
  where candidates for re-use exist.  Validation is time-consuming, perhaps 
  requiring a native speaker of the language to confirm the details.  This is
  the nature of the problem domain however.
- A fairly large assumption is made that only cardinal, nominative numbers 
  are required to be represented.  This is fine for counting, but if we are 
  trying to say 'six chairs', then the problem of gender and accusative, 
  dative, etc. comes into play.  For example, Polish has a table of variations 
  of the number 1, depending on gender, plurality and cases (nominative,
  accusative, etc). [1], [2].  This can introduce problems if representing 
  currency amounts, for example.
- The project to analyse the suitability of this approach has not progressed 
  beyond Europe.  It is not yet known how feasible Asian language systems (for 
  example) would adapt to this scheme.  Either a Romanized system or Unicode 
  could be used for the representations, but it is not yet known whether the 
  syntax would lend itself well to the approach taken by NaturalNum.
  
Further Work
------------
NaturalNum could be developed in the following ways:

- Add new languages, particularly untested classes of language, e.g. Chinese
- Expose as a web service
- Extend configuration into the millions, and beyond
- Create further abstractions to represent variations with respect to the 
  gender and class of the related noun.  A possible way to capture this:
